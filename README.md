# MY-PROJECT
Academic Analytics Data Warehouse Project Report1. Project ObjectiveThe goal of this project is to apply Data Warehousing concepts to create a unified, subject-oriented, and historical repository for academic data. This will enable data-driven decision-making regarding student success and institutional efficiency.Identifying a meaningful problem: The challenge of fragmented data across Student Information Systems (SIS) and Learning Management Systems (LMS) leading to poor analytical capability.Designing a technical solution: Implementing a Star Schema Data Warehouse using PostgreSQL and a Python-based ETL process.Implementing the solution: Developing the dimensional model and the ETL logic, including Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD).Demonstrating understanding: Evidenced by the use of dimensional modeling, ETL orchestration (Airflow), and SCD Type 2 for historical tracking.2. Scope & Requirements2.1 Functional Requirements (FR)Your project must include at least three major functional modules:Three major functional modules:Data Source Integration (Extraction Module): Integrates data from disparate sources (SIS, LMS, Financials). (FR1)Data Transformation & Cleansing (Transformation Module): Cleanses, applies SCD logic, and calculates derived measures (e.g., standardized Grade_Point). (FR2, FR3)Reporting & Analytics (BI Layer): Supports slicing/dicing of data for reports and dashboards. (FR4)A logical workflow of how the user interacts with the system: The final user (Academic Staff/Registrar) interacts with the Business Intelligence Layer (Tableau/Power BI), which queries the optimized Fact and Dimension tables in the Data Warehouse.2.2 Non-Functional Requirements (NFR)You must specify at least four (4) non-functional requirements:IDRequirementDescriptionNFR1Performance (Query)80% of standard analytical reports must execute in under 10 seconds.NFR2Reliability (Data Latency)The data warehouse must be refreshed daily (24-hour latency) via an automated ETL job.NFR3ScalabilityThe design must accommodate a 50% growth in student enrollment over 5 years.NFR4UsabilityThe final BI reporting interface must be intuitive for non-technical academic staff.3. Technical ExpectationsProper architectural design: Classic three-layer Data Warehouse architecture (Source, Staging/ETL, Data Warehouse, BI Layer).Correct application of subject concepts: Utilizes Star Schema, Surrogate Keys, and SCD Type 2.Modular and clean implementation: ETL logic is separated into distinct, reusable Python modules (extractor, transformer, loader).Version control usage (Git): All source code (ETL scripts, DDL) is managed in a GitHub repository.Minimum 5-10 meaningful modules/classes/files: Includes sis_extractor.py, lms_transformer.py, dw_loader.py, scd_logic.py, grade_calc.py, airflow_dag.py, and database DDL scripts.
